To install SSAsm, simply copy/move the ssasm DIRECTORY (including ssasm, ssasm_footer.txt, ssasm_header.txt, etc.) to 
any safe location you have access to ($HOME/bin, /usr/local/bin, etc.)
then, simply add the ssasm directory to your PATH and you're ready.

---
EXAMPLE INSTALLING SSASM IN $HOME/BIN (assuming bash is your default shell):

linux% mv ssasm $HOME/bin/
linux% echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/ssasm' >>$HOME/.bash_profile

---
EXAMPLE INSTALLING SSASM IN /usr/local/bin (assuming you are root and you mostly use bash)):

linux% mv ssasm /usr/local/bin/
linux% echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/ssasm' >>/etc/profile
